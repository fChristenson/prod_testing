# Production testing

## What we will cover

- What does prod testing mean?
- Why do we want to do prod testing?
- What issues do we face with prod testing?
- How can we solve these problems?

## Notes

Testing in production is considered by many as either a very bad idea or at the very least really hard.

However this is the best form of testing if we can pull it off.

If we can be sure that we don't cause any problems like sending out data to third parties or log metrics
we can get the most realistic testing there is.
